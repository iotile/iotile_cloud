Hello from the Arch team!

This is to let you know that the project {{ project_name }} ({{ project_slug }}) could not be deleted.

Projects cannot be deleted if there are devices still claimed by the project.

You will have to move each device to another project before deleting the project.

Devices:
    
{% for d in devices %}
{{ d.slug }}
{% endfor %}

{% endlocaltime %}
{% include 'base/email.txt' %}
